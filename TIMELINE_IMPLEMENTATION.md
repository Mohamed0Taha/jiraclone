# Timeline Implementation Update

## Overview
The Timeline component has been completely rewritten to use the `react-calendar-timeline` library instead of a custom implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added
- `react-calendar-timeline` - Professional timeline component library

### 2. New Features
- **Drag & Drop**: Tasks can be moved between different status groups by dragging
- **Resize**: Task duration can be adjusted by dragging the start/end edges
- **Interactive Timeline**: Professional timeline interface with zoom, scroll, and navigation
- **Better Date Handling**: Robust date parsing and range calculation
- **Responsive Design**: Timeline adapts to different screen sizes
- **Theme Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with the existing dark/light theme system

### 3. Data Structure
The component maintains the same props interface:
- `project`: Project data object
- `tasks`: Object with status groups (todo, inprogress, review, done)
- `users`: Array of user objects

### 4. Timeline Groups
Tasks are organized by status:
- **To Do** - Gray (#64748B)
- **In Progress** - Blue (#0EA5E9)  
- **Review** - Purple (#8B5CF6)
- **Done** - Green (#10B981)

### 5. Event Handlers
- `handleItemMove`: Handles task status change and date updates via drag & drop
- `handleItemResize`: Handles date changes via edge dragging
- `handleItemClick`: Basic click interactions
- `handleItemDoubleClick`: Navigate back to task board

### 6. Styling
Custom CSS file (`resources/css/timeline.css`) provides:
- Theme-aware styling for dark/light modes
- Smooth hover effects and animations
- Consistent visual design with the rest of the application
- Responsive adjustments for mobile devices

### 7. Navigation Controls
- **Zoom In/Out**: Adjust timeline scale
- **Go to Today**: Quick navigation to current date
- **Date Range Display**: Shows current visible time range

### 8. Empty State
When no tasks are present, displays a helpful message encouraging users to add tasks with dates.

## Usage
The component automatically calculates the optimal date range based on task dates and project timeline. It provides visual feedback for:
- Tasks with proper start/end dates
- Tasks missing end dates
- Total task count and scheduling status

## Future Enhancements
The event handlers are prepared for API integration to persist timeline changes:
- Task status updates when moved between groups
- Date updates when tasks are resized or moved
- Real-time synchronization with the backend

## Dependencies
Make sure to install the required package:
```bash
npm install react-calendar-timeline
```

The component imports both the library CSS and custom styling for optimal appearance.
