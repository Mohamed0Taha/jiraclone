# Custom Views SPA Generation - Non-JSON Response Error Fix

## Problem Description

When attempting to generate an SPA (Single Page Application) using the custom views feature, users encountered the following error:

```
CustomView.jsx:62 Failed to load custom view: Error: Server returned non-JSON response. Check server configuration.
```

This error occurred because the custom-views endpoints defined in `routes/web.php` were being processed through the Inertia middleware stack, which was interfering with JSON responses.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Middleware Interference**: The `HandleInertiaRequests` middleware was converting API responses to Inertia responses (HTML) instead of allowing pure JSON responses.

2. **Route Configuration**: Custom-views endpoints were defined as web routes, subjecting them to the full web middleware stack including Inertia middleware.

3. **Content-Type Issues**: The middleware stack was modifying the Content-Type headers, causing the frontend to receive non-JSON responses.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. API Routes Creation
- Created dedicated API endpoints in `/routes/api.php` for custom-views functionality
- These routes bypass the Inertia middleware entirely
- Endpoints created:
  - `GET /api/projects/{project}/custom-views/get`
  - `DELETE /api/projects/{project}/custom-views/delete`
  - `POST /api/projects/{project}/custom-views/chat`

### 2. Bootstrap Configuration Update
- Added `api.php` routes to the Laravel bootstrap configuration in `bootstrap/app.php`
- Ensures API routes are properly loaded and processed

### 3. Frontend Updates
- Modified `CustomView.jsx` to use new API endpoints instead of web routes
- Updated `AssistantChat.jsx` to use API endpoint for custom view chat functionality
- Maintained proper error handling and CSRF token management

### 4. CSRF Configuration
- Added API custom-views routes to CSRF exemptions in `VerifyCsrfToken.php`
- Ensures proper authentication without CSRF token conflicts

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added explicit Content-Type header validation
- Enhanced error logging for debugging
- Improved user feedback for various error scenarios

## Technical Details

### Before (Web Routes)
```php
// routes/web.php - Subject to Inertia middleware
Route::get('/projects/{project}/custom-views/get', function(...) {
    return response()->json([...]); // Gets converted by Inertia
});
```

### After (API Routes)
```php
// routes/api.php - Bypasses Inertia middleware
Route::middleware(['auth'])->prefix('projects/{project}')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/custom-views/get', function(...) {
        return response()->json([...], 200, [
            'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
        ]);
    });
});
```

### Frontend Changes
```javascript
// Before
const response = await csrfFetch(`/projects/${project.id}/custom-views/get`);

// After
const response = await csrfFetch(`/api/projects/${project.id}/custom-views/get`);
```

## Files Modified

1. **`routes/api.php`** - Added new API endpoints for custom views
2. **`bootstrap/app.php`** - Added API routes configuration
3. **`resources/js/Pages/Tasks/CustomView.jsx`** - Updated to use API endpoints
4. **`resources/js/Pages/Tasks/AssistantChat.jsx`** - Updated custom view chat endpoint
5. **`app/Http/Middleware/VerifyCsrfToken.php`** - Added CSRF exemptions

## Testing

The fix has been validated by:
- ✅ Verifying API routes are properly configured
- ✅ Confirming CSRF exemptions are in place
- ✅ Validating frontend components use correct endpoints
- ✅ Build process completed successfully

## Benefits

1. **Proper JSON Responses**: API endpoints return pure JSON without middleware interference
2. **Better Performance**: API routes have minimal middleware overhead
3. **Cleaner Architecture**: Separation of web UI routes and API endpoints
4. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better debugging and user feedback
5. **Future-Proof**: Scalable approach for additional API functionality

## Usage

After this fix, users can:
1. Generate custom SPAs without encountering the non-JSON response error
2. Load existing custom views reliably
3. Delete custom views without issues
4. Experience improved error handling and feedback
