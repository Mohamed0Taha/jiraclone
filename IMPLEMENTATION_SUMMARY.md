# Implementation Summary: Generated View Navigation

## Problem Solved
Users couldn't easily navigate to their AI-generated views because they were only accessible from within the DynamicViewManager dialog. Once closed, views were difficult to find and access.

## Solution Implemented
Added persistent view chips to the main board header that:
1. **Display saved views** as clickable chips next to the AI Tasks button
2. **Enable quick navigation** by clicking on any saved view chip
3. **Update in real-time** when new views are created
4. **Persist across sessions** using localStorage

## Key Files Modified
- `Board.jsx` - Added view state management and loading logic
- `HeaderBanner.jsx` - Added view chips display with styling
- `DynamicViewManager.jsx` - Enhanced with view selection and callbacks

## Technical Features
- ✅ Read saved views from localStorage on component mount
- ✅ Display views as Material-UI chips with consistent styling
- ✅ Handle click events to load specific views in DynamicViewManager
- ✅ Real-time updates when views are saved through callback system
- ✅ Error handling for localStorage operations
- ✅ Responsive design matching existing header layout

## User Experience
- Views are now prominently visible on the main board
- Single click access to any saved view
- Visual indicator showing number of saved views
- Consistent design with existing UI components
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Testing
Created comprehensive test suite validating:
- View creation and persistence
- Chip display and interaction
- Click handling and navigation
- Real-time synchronization
- Error handling scenarios

The implementation provides a seamless way for users to access their generated views without having to remember what they created or search through dialogs.
